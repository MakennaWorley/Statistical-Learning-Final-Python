# Statistical Learning Final Project  
### **Evaluating Linear Models & Shrinkage Methods for Predicting a Simulated Polygenic Trait**

**Author:** Makenna Worley  
**Course:** Statistical Learning (Fall 2025)  
**Dataset:** Generated data using [**make_msprime_dataset.py**](https://github.com/MakennaWorley/Capstone-Playground-Python/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) from my Capstone-Playground-Python Repo

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project uses a fully simulated genetic dataset generated with [**msprime**](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/intro.html) to investigate how accurately different linear modeling strategies recover the underlying genetic architecture of a polygenic quantitative trait. The dataset includes a polygenic score derived from true causal variants, environmental covariates, demographic information, and optional population structure (PCs), allowing precise control over the ground truth. By comparing simple linear models, subset selection procedures, and shrinkage methods (ridge, lasso, elastic net), this analysis quantifies how much of the trait’s variance is attributable to genetic vs environmental factors and evaluates the stability and interpretability of coefficient estimates. Because the simulation provides the true causal effect sizes (β) used to construct the polygenic score, the project can directly assess how closely each model recovers the real underlying signal.

This work is completed as part of a Statistical Learning course and focuses on linear regression, subset selection, and shrinkage methods within a controlled genetic simulation framework.

The dataset contains:

- A quantitative phenotype (`quant_trait`)
- A polygenic score (`polygenic_score`)
- Environmental covariates (`env_index`)
- Demographic factors (`sex`, `age`)
- Optional population structure (PC1, PC2)
- A separate variant file with **true effect sizes** (`beta`) and causal status (`is_causal`)

This setup allows us to directly test which statistical models:

- Predict phenotype best  
- Capture genetic vs environmental contributions  
- Produce the most stable and interpretable coefficients  
- Most closely match the **true** simulated effect sizes  

This project serves as a **stepping stone** for my capstone on probabilistic ancestral genotype inference.

## 🎯 **Research Question**

> **How well do linear models, subset selection methods, and shrinkage methods recover the true genetic architecture of a polygenic quantitative trait?**

Sub-questions include:

1. How much variance in the trait is explained by PRS alone vs environment?  
2. Do shrinkage methods (ridge, lasso, elastic net) produce more stable and accurate coefficient estimates?  
3. How do coefficient estimates compare to the true underlying effect sizes?  
4. Does adding population structure (PCs) improve predictive performance?
